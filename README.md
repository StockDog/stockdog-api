## Learn to invest while competing with friends!

### Our Mission
> Investing is a useful life skill valuable to all young adults. However, to learn how to invest, young adults require knowledge of the market, sufficient capital, and a driving motivator. There exist classes that teach the ropes of the stock market, but there is no denying practice is the best educator. Young adults havenâ€™t had a chance to earn enough money to expend on the stock market. Lastly, even though there exist applications with virtual money for users to practice investing, they lack the proper motivation to keep users engaged. We hope to solve these problems to allow young adults to get acquainted with the market in a captivating fashion.
